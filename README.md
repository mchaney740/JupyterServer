First Github Project
This Dockerfile creates a Jupyter Lab server running on tcp port 8888. It is intended to run with a volume mount mapped to a network share (samba) so that all project files are centralized and adding/removing files are simplified.

The container works with Podman/Docker and the usage is the same for both as of 7/1/2024.
